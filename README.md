## About Me 

Hi, I'm Le Hoang Truong, a graduate of ITMO University with a degree in Applied Computer Science. I have a strong passion for algorithms, software engineering, and building robust back-end systems.

🔧 I have hands-on experience with multiple programming languages including Java, Python, JavaScript, and C++.  
⚙️ I work with modern frameworks and tools such as Spring Boot, Django, Node.js, and Vue.js.  
🌱 Currently deepening my knowledge in advanced optimization methods and system design.  
🚀 I’m actively looking to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate on innovative tech solutions.  
🧠 I'm also interested in tackling advanced algorithmic challenges and improving my competitive programming skills.  
💬 Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss web development, backend architecture, or just talk code!  
⚡ Fun fact: I love coding competitions — they’re my version of a workout for the brain.
